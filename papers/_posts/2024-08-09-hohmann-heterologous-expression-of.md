# Abstract

Human health is greatly influenced by the gut microbiota and microbiota imbalance can lead to the development of diseases. It is widely acknowledged that the interaction of bacteria within competitive ecosystems is influenced by their specialized metabolites, which act, e.g., as antibacterials or siderophores. However, our understanding of the occurrence and impact of such natural products in the human gut microbiome remains very limited. As arylthiazole siderophores are an emerging family of growth-promoting molecules in pathogenic bacteria, we analyzed a metagenomic dataset from the human microbiome and thereby identified the bil-BGC, which originates from an uncultured Bilophila strain. Through gene synthesis and BGC assembly, heterologous expression and mutasynthetic experiments, we discovered bilothiazoles A-F, new arylthiazole natural products. While established activities of related molecules indicate their involvement in metal-binding and -uptake, which could promote the growth of pathogenic strains, we also found antibiotic activity for some bilothiazoles. This is supported by biosensor-experiments, where bilothiazoles C and E show PrecA-suppressing activity, while bilothiazole F induces PblaZ, a biosensor characteristic for -lactam antibiotics. These findings serve as a starting point for investigating the role of bilothiazoles in the pathogenicity of Bilophila species in the gut.
