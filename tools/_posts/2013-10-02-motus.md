## Abstract
Taxonomic profiling is a fundamental task in microbiome research that encompasses detection and quantification of microorganisms in biological samples. Many profiling tools for profiling from shotgun metagenomic data rely on reference genomes, introducing estimation biases because many microbial taxa are not represented in reference genome databases – not even for very well-studied environments such as the human gut. The mOTUs (MG-based Operational Taxonomic Units) approach leverages well-established universal, single-copy, protein-coding marker genes to profile microbial abundances in shotgun metagenomic data. This approach allows the mOTUs algorithm to address both cultivation biases (since universal marker genes can be directly extracted from metagenomes even for uncultivated organisms) as well as genome size biases, which together results in very high precision and recall as evident from the latest Critical Assessment of Metagenome Interpretation (CAMI 2) challenge.  

For many years, we have been developing mOTUs jointly with [Shinichi Sunagawa’s group](https://micro.biol.ethz.ch/research/sunagawa.html) at ETH Zurich, with [Daniel Mende’s group](https://www.amc.nl/web/specialismen/medische-microbiologie-infectiepreventie-1/medische-microbiologie-infectiepreventie-1/daniel-mende.htm) and UMC Amsterdam and with [Peer Bork’s group](https://www.embl.org/groups/bork/) at EMBL Heidelberg. mOTUs is published under the [GPL-3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) licence.
