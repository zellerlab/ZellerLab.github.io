Jannie obtained a Bachelor’s in Nutrition and Health and a Master’s in Molecular Nutrition and Toxicology, both at Wageningen University & Research in the Netherlands. With a keen interest for the interaction between nutrition, health and the intestinal microbiome, she started her PhD research in the Molecular Ecology group under guidance of Prof. Dr. Jan Knol (Nutricia Research, Utrecht, the Netherlands) and Dr. Clara Belzer (Laboratory of Microbiology, Wageningen University & Research). The focus of her PhD research was the maturation of the gastrointestinal tract and of the intestinal microbes in preterm infants with their implications for infant growth, development and health.

In her role managing the [Center for Microbiome Analyses and Therapeutics (CMAT)](https://www.lumc.nl/en/research/facilities/center-for-microbiome-analyses-and-therapeutics/), Jannie is co-affiliated with the Zeller lab. For CMAT, she is coordinating research and data analysis projects. In addition, she researches the human microbiome and its therapeutic potential in a broad range of diseases, with a focus on bacteria, fungi and archaea.
