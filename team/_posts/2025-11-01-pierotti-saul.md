Saul joined the Zeller lab in 2025 after completing his PhD in statistical genetics in Ewan Birney's group at the European Bioinformatics Institute and the University of Cambridge (UK). He previously obtained an MSc in Bioinformatics from the University of Bologna (Italy) and a BSc in Biotechnology from the University of Perugia (Italy).

In the Zeller lab, Saul's research focuses on characterising the role of the human gut microbiome in drug metabolism and its influence on treatment outcomes across different diseases, with the ultimate goal of informing clinical practice. His work centres on developing statistical methods to analyse heterogeneous, multi-omics longitudinal datasets, drawing inspiration from analytical frameworks established in statistical genetics. He is also interested in characterising gut microbiome dysbiosis within an interpretable statistical framework.
