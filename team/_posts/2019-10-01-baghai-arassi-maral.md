Maral joined the group as a clinician scientist in October 2019. A graduate of the University of Freiburg Faculty of Medicine, she completed her paediatric residency in November 2023. Currently she is a fellow in paediatric nephrology at the University Children’s Hospital in Heidelberg.  

Her research is dedicated to understanding how the gut microbiome influences kidney transplantation and uses both reductionistic experimental studies and extensive clinical trials. She focuses on the interactions between immunosuppressive drugs and gut bacteria, aiming to personalise immunosuppressive therapy to reduce post-transplant complications.
