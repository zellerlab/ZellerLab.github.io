Sankeert joined the group as a postdoctoral researcher in May 2025. He completed his BS-MS dual degree in Biological Sciences at IISER Kolkata, India, with a minor in Physical Sciences (2016–2021). His research focused on subcellular and cellular dynamics and motility, stochastic modelling of biofilm size regulation, and developing 3D imaging workflows for Drosophila border cell migration analysis. In 2021, he began his PhD at ACQUIFER LUXENDO as part of the INFLANET MSCA consortium, enrolled at the Faculty of Biosciences, University of Heidelberg.  His doctoral work focused on developing high-throughput workflow tools for zebrafish time-lapse imaging, including engineering multiplexed imaging assays and building software and analytical pipelines to study dynamic biological processes at scale.

Sankeert joined the team as a postdoctoral researcher to continue and expand efforts in decoding microbe–host interactions in tumors using spatial data. His main focus is on developing and applying bioimage analysis tools for segmentation, registration, and spatial niche mapping in fluorescence imaging datasets. He works on integrating spatial and bulk omics data to uncover links between the tumor, immune system, and microbiome.
