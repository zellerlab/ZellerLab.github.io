Iphigénie joined the Zeller lab as a PhD student in November 2023. She earned her Master's degree in Bioinformatics from the Université Paris Cité. Driven by a curiosity cultivated during her academic journey, she diversified her interests from a first research experience in phylogeny to cancer cell signalling, which ultimately led to her Master's thesis on plant genomics and plant adaptation to the environment.  

Iphigénie is now passionate about advancing our understanding of the gut microbiome with the Zeller lab. As she begins her PhD journey, she brings a foundational knowledge in omics data analysis and a keen interest in systems biology. She is embarking on a project on delineating  gut dysbiosis as well as healthy gut microbiome states. Comparing microbiome-disease signatures across many conditions, the goal of this project is to obtain more quantitative models of the diseased and healthy gut.
