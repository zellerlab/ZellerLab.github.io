Alberto joined the Zeller lab in Leiden in March 2025 as an Intern and Master’s student from the Quantitative and Computational Biology program at the University of Trento, Italy. His BSc degree in Molecular Biology he obtained from the University of Padova in December 2023.

In his Master’s thesis project, Alberto investigates the effects of dietary fiber interventions on the gut microbiome and compares these across studies and fibre types. More broadly, he is interested in applying computational approaches to understand how different dietary interventions reshape microbiome composition and function as well as host–microbiome interactions.
