Georg studied Computational and Molecular Biology (majoring in Computer Science) at Tübingen and Uppsala University. In 2010 he obtained a PhD for machine learning-based analyses of genomics and transcriptomics data from model organisms (A. thaliana and C. elegans) at the Max Planck Institutes in Tübingen. Afterwards he joined Peer Bork's group at EMBL Heidelberg to work as a postdoctoral fellow on analysing chemogenomics and metagenomics data. In 2015 he was appointed as an independent Team Leader at EMBL Heidelberg in the Structural and Computational Biology Unit. In November 2023 he moved to the Leiden University Medical Center as an Associate Professor at the Leiden University Center for Infectious Diseases (LUCID) and has since re-established his research group there.  

His research interests include computational and experimental method development for clinical microbiome studies with the goal of applying these tools to gain a better understanding of how the human microbiome is shaped by host factors such as nutrition and drug intake and how the microbiome modulates these environmental influences on host physiology. Ultimately he explores how this knowledge can be leveraged to maintain human health, revert dysbiosis, and improve treatment outcomes in novel personalised medicine approaches.
